					<h2>What is Psychosocial Recovery Coaching?</h2>
					<img src="assets/icons/service-fill.svg" alt="service icon" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Psychosocial Recovery Coaching is a new support within NDIS from July 2020. Recovery Coaches should help participants with a psychosocial disability manage day to day tasks in a sometimes
					complex world. Working alongside other supports, such as family, friends, other services and helping to implement an effective NDIS Plan will help pave the way for meaningful life. If this
					type of support sounds a little bit broad, it's because it is. No two participants are the same and therefore this service is flexible to ensure that people who need it, are able to access
					it. Whilst utilising Recovery Principles, Recovery Coaches aim to have you managing more of your own day to day life.

					<h2>What is Support Coordination?</h2>
					<img src="assets/icons/bubble-chart-fill.svg" alt="bubble icon" />
				</div>

				<p>
					Support Coordination is a service that helps participants learn more about their NDIS Plans and coordinates the supports within it. A Support Coordinator will ensure that a mixture of funded
					supports are booked and implemented so that it is not left to the participant or loved ones to manage. Usually these supports are based around ensuring that the participant has access to
					services that will help them access community life, therapies, maintain relationships and anything else funded within an NDIS plan. In short, a Support Coordinator will put your plan into
					action and help it run smo0thly, ensuring it stays based on the participantâ€™s needs.
